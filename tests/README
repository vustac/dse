Multi-dimensional Array tests:
-------------------------------------------------------------

  Name:        MultiArraySquare
  Command:      run_multiarray_nonsquare
  Source:       arrays/multidim_square/MultiArraySquare.java
  Description:  verifies entries in a 2-dim square array can be solved symbolicly.
                It does so by first initializing a 3x3 byte matrix with values starting at a given
                'value' and incrementing each successive entry column-by column then row-by-row.
                Then it checks for where the 1st entry is greater than the last entry filled.
                The solution is when the byte value rolls over from 127 to -128 between the first
                and last entry.
  Symbolic:     'value' = slot 3 of MultiArraySquare.testSquare()
